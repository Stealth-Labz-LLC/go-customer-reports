                    <p><strong><span class="text-lg">(Boulder, CO) - For millions battling daily discomfort, this news couldn't be more exciting.</span></strong></p>
                    <p class="m-t-25">An ancient herb is taking the U.S. by storm and it's finally available to be purchased without a prescription. And the
                        best part is…
                    </p>
                    <p class="m-t-25">It uses a new delivery system that’s 450% more absorbable than traditional capsules and tastes amazing; giving you 5x more relief for your buck without leaving a sour taste in your mouth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="m-t-25">Red Dragon contains two key alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine which can help relieve even the
                        most agonizing joint discomfort along with general muscle aches,
                        soreness, sleep disorders, anxiety and many other ailments. And since it's 100% natural and organic, your body is able to process the herb and feel the effects within minutes. </p>
                    <p class="m-t-25">It also calms, relaxes, and eases tension all over the body.</p><br>

                    <p class="info-box"><strong>A CAPSULE A DAY SOOTHES PAIN AWAY:</strong> <a href="<?php echo $ctaLink; ?>"><b><u>Red Dragon</u></b></a> contains a 1800 milligram dose of Kratom that works day and night to keep you comfortable and healthy.</p>
                    <p class="m-t-25">Exciting new scientific research shows that Kratom contains special relief compounds called alkaloids which interact with your bodies opioid receptors. When taken orally, Red Dragon binds to these receptors, and soothing comfort begins to take form almost immediately.

                    <!--<p class="whythis"><strong>Why This Herb Is Better Than CBD For Pain</strong></p>
                        <p class="m-t-25">Unfortunately, by now you've heard of CBD which is touted as a miracle pain relief solution.  The problem is, CBD products sold online don't contain enough THC to even be effective at relieving pain.  As a result, these poorly constructed products have little-to-no impact on pain.  According to Robert H. Shmerling of Harvard Health, “We are still waiting for well-designed, scientifically valid, and rigorous clinical trials that are so badly needed to answer the question of just how helpful CBD may be to people with chronic pain.”
                        </p>
                        <a href="<?php echo $ctaLink; ?>"><img src="images/amazing/powder-capsules.jpg" alt="" class="mt-5 mb-5" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;max-width:100%;height:auto" border="0"></a>
                        <p class="m-t-25" style="padding:10px 0px 10px 0px;">Another contributor to Harvard Health, Shafik Boyaji, MD explains "Currently, CBD alone is not approved for treatment of pain in the United States. But a combination medication (that contains both THC and CBD in a 1:1 ratio) was approved by Health Canada for prescription for certain types of pain...There is currently no high-quality research study that supports the use of CBD alone for the treatment of pain."  This is why we're excited to offer <a href="<?php echo $ctaLink; ?>">Red Dragon</a> as a more effective solution for pain.

                    <p class="m-t-25"><strong>Kelsey Radford, a 60 year old grandmother was one of the first users to try Red Dragon Kratom.</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br> "I was plagued by the symptoms of Fibromyalgia and arthritis. I
                        couldn't get out of bed. I was in pain constantly. And the 'Cures' were
                        worse than the symptoms. They had me on harsh drugs. I was bed-ridden
                        and severely depressed. My life was over." <br>
                        <br> "Just a few days after I started taking Red Dragon, I started noticing
                        a difference. I've been taking them for 4 months now - And <em><strong>I'm happy to say, I
                                don't take any meds except Kratom. It has changed my life that
                                dramatically. I'm not exaggerating when I say Red Dragon gave me my life back."
                            </strong></em>
                    </p>

                        <p class="whythis"><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
                        <p class="m-t-25">The key to Red Dragon's health benefits is the
                            opiods, a network of receptors in the brain. The system
                            is there to control pain and reward in the body. When the body feels pain, the opiods work to block that pain.
                        </p>
                        <p class="m-t-25">“It’s really amazing God-given system that’s been
                            completely overlooked. Our bodies are practically designed to work with
                            the compounds in Kratom, which is why we need a solution like Red Dragon that
                            unleashes its full potential.”
                        </p>
                        <p class="m-t-25">Over time, with aging, the bodies natural ability to manage pain
                            eventually burns out.The result is, all sorts of symptoms of aging like
                            age-related memory loss, blurry vision, joint discomfort, aches and
                            pains, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and other ailments become more prevalent.
                        </p>
                        <p class="m-t-25">In fact, a recent study revealed that <strong>91% of users take Kratom as an alternative to prescription medications.</strong> You can see the results from a recent study performed by John Hopkins Medicine about Kratom:</p><br><br>
