### Multi-Site Potential

The platform supports multiple sites from a single codebase:

```
If you can run 1 site from this codebase...

1 site   = Base revenue
3 sites  = 3x potential (different niches)
10 sites = 10x potential (portfolio approach)

Each site: $1K-$40K+ monthly revenue potential
Portfolio value compounds with each addition
