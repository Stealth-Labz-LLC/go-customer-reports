                <div class="content-group">
                    <p>We all know how frustrating and annoying a slow, spotty WiFi connection can be.</p>
                    <p>Our favorite TV shows constantly pause to buffer, our connection is not much better than the dial-up days, and the whole WiFi seems to crash or slow down tremendously when everyone is home using it.</p>
                    <p>Sounds familiar, right? </p>
                    <p>But after giving the Range XTD a try, I honestly don’t know where to start. But the first thing I got to tell you is…. WOW.</p>
                    <p>These are the reasons I highly recommend the Range XTD to anyone struggling with slow or laggy connections: </p>
                    <h2>1. It Maxes Out Your WiFi Speed All Over Your Home</h2>
                    <p> When I first bought this, I was a little doubtful this small device would do much of anything. But after plugging it in and setting up, I noticed an immediate difference. </p>
                    <p> Out of curiosity, I wanted to see just how much the RangeXTD actually increased my speed, so I did a simple speed test on speedtest.net:</p>
                    <div class="image-wrapper">
                        <img data-src="images/wifidevice/img02.jpg" class="lazyload img">
                    </div>
                    <p>It turns out it increased my speed in my office from a little over 50 mbps to almost 300 mbps. That’s over 5x as fast!</p>
                    <p>If you are paying for "fast" internet from your provider but you feel like your WiFi isn't quite living up to the advertised speeds. This could be the device that fixes that for you.</p>
                    <h2>2. The Expansive Signal Range Covered My Entire House And Yard  </h2>
                    <p> Along with the incredible speed, the other thing I noticed later was where I got reception. I used to always have a hard time getting reception in our kitchen and our basement. </p>
                    <p> Both are about 30 feet away from the router. But once this thing started up, it was never an issue again. The only place I didn’t seem to get signal was in our yard about 60 feet away. </p>
                    <p> Both are about 30 feet away from the router. But once this thing started up, it was never an issue again. The only place I didn’t seem to get signal was in our yard about 60 feet away. </p>
                    <div class="image-wrapper">
                        <img data-src="images/wifidevice/img03.png" class="lazyload img">
                    </div>
                    <h2>3. Disconnects Took A Hike  </h2>
                    <p> Before I bought my Range XTD, our WiFi would crash and disconnect ALL. THE. TIME. And always at the worst moments ﹘ during an important Zoom meeting, while streaming a big game, and while playing video games online. </p>
                    <p> But after using the Range XTD for a few weeks, I found myself enjoying WiFi like I used to. I became the old juggernaut I used to be in online games. I was now the one getting the drop on others who lagged out. Not gonna lie - it felt good for a change.  </p>
                    <h2>4. Buffering…. 40%.... 62%..... 78%..... 96%......    </h2>
                    <p> The one feature I’m most impressed by is how my WiFi never seems to buffer or take its time loading anymore. Before I installed my Range XTD, it used to take forever for our shows to load. </p>
                    <p> But now, I almost never see the loading screen. I click play and BOOM. Loading screen is already at 100% and it begins playing.  </p>
                    <div class="image-wrapper">
                        <img data-src="images/wifidevice/img05.jpg" class="lazyload img">
                    </div>
                    <h2>5. Painless Setup    </h2>
                    <p> You would think something so powerful would require a technician to drill holes in the wall for cables and other hookups. But the Range XTD is just a simple Plug-and-Play installation. </p>
                    <div class="image-wrapper">
                        <img data-src="images/wifidevice/img06.jpg" class="lazyload img">
                    </div>
                    <p> Overall, the set-up is really easy to do. You just plug it into an outlet and press a couple buttons and you’re done. The installation is really easy to follow with step by step instructions and takes about 30 seconds in total. </p>
                    <p>You honestly don’t need to be tech-savvy to use this at all. Even my 14-year-old son could set this up. </p>
                    <p class="hottset-text">  Note: do NOT plug it into an outlet close to your router. I made this mistake originally and didn’t see great results at first. I would definitely recommend plugging it into an outlet about 20-30 feet away for maximum results.</p>
                    <div class="section-subtitle">
                        <h2>The Final Verdict: </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Overall, I would give the Range XTD a 9.8 / 10.  </p>
                    <p>Not only was it the easiest set-up I’ve ever done for anything tech-related, it was also the most impressive gadget I’ve seen in the past few years.</p>
                    <p>It does exactly as advertised; however, I would still highly suggest buying more than one of these, especially if you have a home with multiple floors or lots of walls.</p>
                    <p>You also need to be careful how you set it up. If you plug it in too close to your router as I mentioned earlier, you may not see the results you’re looking for right away.  Range XTD works best when it's plugged in midway between your router and the edge of your home.</p>
                    <p> But once you install the Range XTD properly, I think you will also notice how much it will fix all of the usual WiFi headaches overnight — no disconnects, no lags, no buffering, and no WiFi dead zones. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-group">
                    <p>Not to mention, how much faster our WiFi speed is now. And when I say “fast,” I mean breakneck, lightning speed fast. It makes going to other people’s houses less enjoyable because their WiFi isn’t as fast as ours now.</p>
                    <div class="image-wrapper">
                        <img data-src="images/wifidevice/img07.jpg" class="lazyload img">
                    </div>
                    <p>So, if you’re looking for a cheaper alternative to upgrading your WiFi internet, I would highly suggest buying the Range XTD for your home.</p>
                    <p> And since I spoke with the vendor and told him how much I loved the Range XTD, he actually worked out an amazing deal to get the Range XTD for 50% off just for the people reading this review right now.</p>
                    <p> Don’t waste another moment with laggy WiFi. Order your Range XTD for 50% today! </p>
